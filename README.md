🏛️ E-Governance Web Application
📌 Overview

The E-Governance Web Application is a Java-based web project designed to provide digital access to government-related services in a secure and user-friendly manner. The application helps streamline public services by allowing users to submit requests, view information, and interact with the system online.

This project is developed using Java, JSP, Servlets, HTML, and CSS, deployed on the Apache Tomcat Server, and uses PHPMyAdmin (MySQL via WAMP Server) as the backend database. The application follows proper separation of concerns between presentation, logic, and data layers.
